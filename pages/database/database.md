Database is a complementary module for Rotor Core. It allows working with remote objects between many devices offering users real-time changes and better mobile data consumption.

Forget things like swipe-to-refresh events, lots of server requests and object storage management. 

**Rotor Database philosophy** states that the only needed requests are those that change data on remote database. 
 
Those few requests are managed by Rotor, so developers don't need to take care of what data is sent or received. They only have to define the object model.

If you have worked with Firebase Real-time Database before, you will be familiarized with that system.

Do you know GraphQL? You should check [Queries And Mask section](/database/queries-masks/).
